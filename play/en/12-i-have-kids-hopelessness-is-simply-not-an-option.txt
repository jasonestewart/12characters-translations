I have kids, hopelessness is simply not an option.

To borrow a familiar metaphor, it seems humanity is stuck on a train barreling forward into the unknown.
The engine car is sealed off from the rest of us.
The driver is either dead, his body slumped over the accelerator, pressing it towards maximum; or long ago lost comms with HQ and is dutifully following the last “forward at all costs” orders he received.
Somewhere far far up ahead there’s a cliff, an unavoidable cliff.

When does the train head over the cliff?
Before I had kids I had it pegged sometime around 2050 when the effects of run-away climate change were expected to kick in hard.
My legs and lungs were due to give out before then, so I didn't get too worked up about it.
I was sad for humanity as a whole, but it was only a vague, world-weary kind of sadness.
Then I had kids — a beautiful boy and a girl — Benjamin and Carson — they’re 15 and 17 now.
Good kids.
Sweet, smart, so much their own people.
I can’t box the future off anymore.
What happens late in the century matters to me now more than I ever thought it could.
The train with my children aboardwill keep hurtling forward, and with it, a piece of me, a living, breathing, heartbreaking piece of me hurtles on into the future.
I won’t physically face the horrors farther down the line, but my heart goes over the cliff every day.
I feel the impossible vertigo, the impact, the dark waters rising.
Now, I have to believe that there’s a way to brake the train or miraculously switch tracks, or for some to jump clear before the end.
I have to have hope.
The alternative is a death sentence for my children.
It doesn’t matter that the data hasn’t changed, my heart has.
A few of us parents have been scheming up a plan to climb across the speeding train and smash our way into the engine car.
It’s impossible, it’ll never succeed, but we’re going to try anyway.
What choice do we have?
