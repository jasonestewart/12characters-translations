It’s gonna happen — but to somebody else

‘Only the little people pay taxes,’ said notorious billionaire socialite, tax-dodger and lover of little dogs Leona Helmsley.
It’s a gross and elitist sentiment, but I realise that’s how I feel about the apocalypse.
It’s gonna happen, but it’s going to happen to somebody else, not me.

It’s gonna happen to those poor fuckers in the Pacific whose islands are disappearing.
It’s gonna happen to old people in the inner city with broken air conditioners when the next ‘unprecedented’ heat wave comes.
(I think they’re gonna have to retire that word soon.) It’s going to happen to all those folks who live on the low-lying coasts — whether in Bangladesh or the Mississippi Delta — who don’t have anywhere else to go.
It’s gonna happen to Africans.
Why does everything bad happen to Africans?
They’re already half starving.
Just wait till their farmland dries up and their crops fail and there’s food riots in the cities and millions teem across the Mediterranean in teetering boats.
Fortress Europa is going to go right-wing in a flash and turn all those boats back.
To where?
I don’t know where.
All I know is I’m not the one who’s going to be doing all the drowning and starving.

Do I think justice is at work here?
Hardly.
It’s pretty much the opposite of justice.
I’m just telling you how it looks from where I stand.
When I imagine the climate apocalypse, when I play out the nightmare scenarios, I’m never in them.
When the final storm comes, I’ve always got someplace to fall back to.
And the means to get there.
And friends to be there with.

In my post-apocalyptic future, somehow I’ve always made it out of the City to a nice farm in Vermont.
The rest of the world is a living hell, but I’m OK.
