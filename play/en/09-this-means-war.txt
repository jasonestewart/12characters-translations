This means war

At first everything happened so piecemeal  a tragedy here, a little catastrophe there  I didn’t know I was under attack.
It felt like the rumble of far-off gun fire in somebody else’s war.
It took a while for it all to come into focus.

If it had been an army of Orcs led by the Eye of Sauron, or gangly robots from Mars, or jackbooted Nazis and their henchmen marching into town, then I would have known.
I would have seen it plainly.
I would have taken up arms, joined the Resistance.
But our 21st Century Lords of Carbon, in their suits and pipelines and feel-good logos, blend in better.
Their ultimate designs, however, are just as evil.
They plunder the land, poison the water, slaughter our animal brothers and sisters.
With five species lost to eternity every day, and the slow-drip of carbon dismembering the planet, they’re driving us all to extinction.

What else is this if not war?

My enemies, it turns out, have names: Exxon.
Peabody Coal.
BP.
Shell.
David Koch.
And addresses: with a few clicks on Google I can find their homes and headquarters.
They are driven by a logic of endless growth regardless of the limits of nature.
They can do nothing else.
As such, my foe is implacable.
I accept this without illusions.
They will not  can not  listen to reason; only power.

We must raise an army to save the world.

And so, I cross over.
I become an instrument of resistance, a vessel of necessity.
I find my unit and train in the strange arts of civil war: encryption, encyclicals, sabotage, message discipline, persuasion, science, disobedience, justice, courage, love, mass action.
Maybe I will not survive; maybe none of us will survive.
So be it.
I prepare myself for battle.
