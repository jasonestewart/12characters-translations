## I want a better catastrophe.

Climate catastrophe is coming.
We know this.
The only question is: What kind of catastrophe and exactly how bad will it be?

In the best case scenario, an unprecedented world-wide Marshall Plan transitions the global economy off of carbon in 30 short years, holding global temperature rise to only 2-3°C.
This causes near-total polar ice melt, a 10 foot sea level rise by 2070, ocean acidification and major habitat disruption.
We lose New York, Shanghai and many of our greatest cities.
Hundreds of thousands of species become extinct but not all.
Systemic crop failure and mass starvation lead to billions of climate refugees, global resource wars and partial social breakdown, but some of us survive, and civilization  in some form  stumbles through.
That’s the best case scenario.
In the worst case scenario, run-away global warming of 6°C+ super-heats the planet and all complex life forms are wiped out.

In the worst case scenario there’s nothing we can do to change the ultimate outcome.
Catastrophe is total.
But here’s the good news: in the best case scenario, what we do matters.
If projections tell us 50% of the Earth’s species are likely to die off, and we can do something to help make that “only” 49%, shouldn’t we try?
Indeed.
We must protect all that we can.
We must do everything in our power to limit the damage, as well as become resilient enough that at least some of us survive with our core values intact.
What we want here is a better catastrophe.

Imagine the protest rallies: “What do we want?
A better catastrophe!
When do we want it?
As late in the century as possible!” Door-to-door recruitment: “Excuse me, Ma’am, would you sign this petition to only half-fuck over the planet?”
A defeatist attitude, you say?
Hardly.
It’s hard-nosed, courageous, and full of hope for the future.
What was Winston Churchill’s rallying cry in the darkest moments of WWII?
“I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat!” Not exactly an upbeat message.
He wasn’t one to over-promise, and nor should we.
He too had a choice of catastrophes: Europe as a Nazi-occupied Death Camp.
Or Europe bombed to pieces and split down the middle, with some take-away wisdom about the nature of evil.
He chose a better catastrophe and so should we.
If catastrophe is where we’re headed, let’s fight hard  lay down our lives if we need to  to get the best catastrophe we can.
