I am prepared

It’s all going to hell, but I’m prepared.
The rest of you can try to stop the disaster.
Go to your protests, your fancy international treaty-meetings, and all that.
Not me.
There’s no fixing this.
It’s all falling apart — and soon.
Some of us are going to be ready; some of us aren’t.
My family and I are going to survive this, even if we’re the last ones on Earth.

I’ve got the bunker all provisioned: enough canned food for two years.
Ten guns.
Lots of ammo.
A generator and an underground tank of diesel.
There’s a couple of us in the same county.
We’re all self-reliant units, but we’re in touch.
The cities are going to be hell, a total race war.
We have to be prepared to protect our own when the exodus comes.
I’ve got the entrances booby-trapped and the exits camouflaged.
I’m ready for things to get ugly.
And, mark my word, they will.
