Let’s party like it’s 2099

The apocalypse is coming and we have no-one to blame but ourselves.
We’ve screwed up the planet and we’re never gonna turn things around in time, there’s just no way.
So fuck it.
I don’t have any kids.
I’m gonna be dead by the time the worst of it happens.
Why not just party?
Just have the best time I possibly can.
Dancing, drinking, jet-skiing — whatever I want — and to hell with global warming.
The apocalypse is coming regardless.
If, thanks to me, it comes five seconds sooner, who really cares?

I mean, really, what else am I supposed to do?
Knock on doors, go to meetings, try to convince people to scrap their SUVs?
Seriously?
That’s just sad.
Almost a sin.
That’s a pathetic way to spend the little time we have left.
No way.
Not for me.
Before the oceans roll in, before they jack up the price of oil, I’m heading out to Thailand, Machu Picchu, New Zealand, Paris, wherever — to see the world.
I’m gonna scratch as many things off my bucket list as I can.

Don’t get me wrong: I’m not happy about all this.
But the way I see it, there’s nothing I can do, and we’re the last generation that gets to let it rip full throttle.
When I hit the clubs with my friends, apocalypse is in the air.
You can almost smell it, heady and voluptuous.
I breathe it in.
I feel fierce; I feel free.
I’m a warrior of the now.
I’m running down the clock, jonesing for more life at the twilight of all things.
We’re the last ones, after all.
We have to make it count.
