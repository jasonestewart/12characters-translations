## Hopelessness can save the world

We have broken Nature.
We have broken the world.
Even the moral logic of struggle has been broken.
Gandhi said, ‘First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win.’
But in the shadow of climate catastrophe, we’d have to update that to: ‘First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then a 6°C increase in the Earth’s temperature wipes out all complex life forms.’
Martin Luther King said, ‘The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.’
But from where we stand now, it’s more accurate to say, ‘The arc of the moral universe might be long, and it might bend towards justice, but we’re never gonna find out because: total ecosystem collapse.’
I used to run on hope.
I used to sign those petitions, show up at those demos, knock on my neighbours’ doors  because I believed we could change things.
But I don’t know anymore.
As a good friend of mine recently said, ‘So what if we’re making progress on police brutality.
Given the climate math, the police might as well shoot us all now.’
It breaks my heart, but it seems our situation is hopeless, and our cause  all our causes  are impossible.

Then again, hasn’t this always been the case?
Look across the full sweep of human history, with its wars and rebellions, its dark and shining moments: every revolution is replaced with the slime of a new bureaucracy.
Every time you manage to overthrow slavery it seems there’s a new Jim Crow waiting for you.
I used to think it was two steps forward one step back, now I’m not so sure.
Things don’t seem to change much for the better, and with the tick tock of carbon slowly poisoning the world, you just stop pretending that they will.
Now, instead of fearing this loss of faith, I welcome it as a revelation: our situation is hopeless.
Our cause is impossible.

Which leaves us with a stark choice: do we dedicate ourselves to an impossible cause?
Or do we pull back and look after our own?
The choice  once you’ve sat quietly with this question  is clear.
You must dedicate yourself to an impossible cause.
Because, just like Archbishop Oscar Romero said when he was asked why he was attending to the sick at a hospital for incurables: ‘We are all incurable.’ Because solidarity is a form of tenderness.
Because the simple act of caring for the world is itself a victory.
We must take a stand  not because it will lead to anything, but because it is the right thing to do.
We never know what can or can’t be done; only what must be done.
I dedicate myself to an impossible cause.
