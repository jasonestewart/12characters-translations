## We can’t save the world by playing by the rules.

When I was eight years old I first heard about something called “climate change.”
Apparently, it was something that humans had created by our way of living.
I was told to turn off the lights to save energy and to recycle paper to save resources.
I remember thinking it was very strange that humans, who are just one of millions of animal species, could be capable of changing the Earth’s climate.
If this were true, how could we be talking about anything else?
As soon as you turned on the TV, everything ought to be about that.
Headlines, radios, newspapers  you simply wouldn’t hear about anything else.
As if there was a World War going on.

But no one ever talked about it.
If burning fossil fuels was so bad that it threatened our very existence, how could we simply continue like before?
Why were there no restrictions?
Why wasn’t it made illegal?
To me, that did not add up.
It was too unreal.

I have Aspberger’s Syndrome.
To me, most things are black or white.
But we Autistics might be the normal ones.
People keep saying that Climate Change is an existential threat, and yet they just carry on like before.
If the emissions have to stop, then we must stop the emissions.
Every day we use 100 million barrels of oil.
If to survive, we need to keep that oil in the ground, then we must to keep that oil in the ground.
To me, that is black and white.
There are no gray areas when it comes to survival.
Either we go on as a civilization or we don’t.
We have to change.

Seriously change: Rich countries like Sweden and the UK need to get down to zero emissions within 6 to 12 years.
How can we expect countries like India or Nigeria to care about the climate crisis if we who already have everything don’t?

When most people think about the future they don’t think beyond the year 2050.
But if I live to be 100, I’ll be alive in the year 2103.
What we do or don’t do right now will affect my entire life and the lives of my children and grandchildren.

When school started in August this year I decided: Enough.
I sat myself down on the ground outside the Swedish Parliament.
I went on strike for the climate.
We can’t save the world by playing by the rules.
Everything needs to change, and it has to start today.
It is time for civil disobedience.
It is time to rebel.
