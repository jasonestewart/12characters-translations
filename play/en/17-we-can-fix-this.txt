We can fix this.

We are facing the greatest challenge in the history of humanity.
In a few short decades we must move the global economy off of carbon or else face total ecosystem collapse.
The task is daunting but we can do it.
We have the technology.
We have the UN.
We have the scientists.
We have the People.
We even have the Pope.
With the possible exception of Exxon’s lobbyists, we’re all on the same team: Team Earth.
Failure is simply not an option.

While I wish we had more time, there is still time.
The only thing lacking is concerted political will.
And that is shifting.
400K in the streets of New York.
Strong agreements coming out of Paris.
Keystone XL pipeline stopped in its tracks.
The tide is turning.
We are starting to win.
The great transformation is beginning.
None of this should come as a surprise: After all, we all want to survive, and nothing mobilizes people better than a clear existential threat.

This is not just a pep-talk I give myself.
This is not just a bullshit story I tell myself to give me a reason to keep on trying.
I sincerely believe we can and will turn things around.
I can see the path forward—it’s clear, doable, and necessary.
Every day I wake up on fire, and I charge down that path.
I keep my eyes on the prize and never look back.

The science is clear: we must fix this.
The policy and technology is clear: we can.
And in my heart I know we will.
