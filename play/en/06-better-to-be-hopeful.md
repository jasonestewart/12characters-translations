## Better to be hopeful

For me, it’s not about the future.
It’s not about what’s going to happen or not happen.
The science is dire, that’s obvious.
And I know humans have a long bloody track record of being our own worst enemy.
I also know we sometimes pull it out in the clutch.
But I’m not banking on one outcome or another.
I’m not hoisting my flag over any particular narrative of history or view of human nature.
I just know how I want to be in the world.
And I want to have hope.
I choose hope.
It makes me feel better.
I get fewer colds and stomach aches.
I’m happier and more focused; I feel right with the world.
I’m going somewhere.
We’re all going somewhere, and we’re going there together.

Oh God, some of you are thinking, please don’t pair me up with this Pollyanna-ish bore at group therapy.
Don’t wet yourself.
I’ve got the full Cards Against Humanity box set.
I’ve got my share of black moods and I do irony just fine, thank you.
I won’t reassure you that everything is going to be OK.
It most certainly won’t be.
I’m not over-bubbling with enthusiasm and cheerfulness, I’m just quietly, soberly hopeful.

The world is fucked up.
Anyone can see that.
War, religious hatred, rape, thousands of square miles of swirling plastic in the ocean.
The list is long.
But life is beautiful.
And that list is longer: the Chrysler building at twilight.
Bill Murray.
A mother cradling her newborn.
The intoxicating smell of my girlfriend’s armpits.
Snow.
The world is fucked up.
So, so fucked up.
But life is beautiful.
And that is enough.
